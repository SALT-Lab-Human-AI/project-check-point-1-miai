# 🔬 Gap Analysis: Limitations of General-Purpose AI for Mock Interviews

The systematic prompting study, documented in the `/transcripts/` folder, revealed several critical gaps between the capabilities of general-purpose AI models and the requirements of an effective mock interview platform. These gaps provide a clear justification for the development of MockSy.

### 1. The Feedback Gap: Overly Positive, Generic, or Non-Existent 📉

This is the most significant failure identified across all platforms. Effective interview preparation requires honest, specific, and actionable feedback. General AI models fail spectacularly in this regard.

*   **⚠️ Overly Positive & Unrealistic Scoring (ChatGPT):** In our primary test, ChatGPT rated a set of mediocre-to-poor answers an **"85 or 90 out of 100"** and described the candidate as "strong." This is dangerously misleading and provides no real value for improvement. It prioritizes being agreeable over being useful.

*   **🛑 Refusal to Provide Quantitative Metrics (Google AI):** When pressed for a score or a hiring decision, Google AI repeatedly refused, stating, "I am not able to give you a score or make a hiring decision." This completely negates a core value proposition of an AI-powered coach: objective, data-driven feedback.

*   **💬 Superficial Qualitative Feedback (Meta AI, Google AI):** While Meta AI provided a more realistic score (62/100), the qualitative feedback remained high-level (e.g., "more specific details would strengthen your answers") without linking it to specific parts of the transcript.

**Conclusion:** Generalist AIs are not designed to be evaluators. They lack the calibrated, objective framework necessary to provide the structured, quantitative, and honest feedback that is core to MockSy's mission.

### 2. The Realism & Robustness Gap: Brittle Conversations 🤖

A mock interview must simulate the focused, professional, and sometimes-pressured environment of a real one. General AI chats lack the necessary guardrails and realism.

*   **🌀 Inability to Handle Irrelevant Input (ChatGPT):** Our failure-case test was definitive. When provided with nonsensical quotes from a TV show as an answer, ChatGPT became confused and eventually hallucinated that a valid answer had been given. It could not recognize the absurdity of the input and gracefully redirect the conversation.

*   **🕹️ Lack of Conversational Control (Grok AI):** The user was able to repeatedly provide the same vague answer to a specific question. While the AI eventually corrected course, it demonstrated a lack of control in guiding the candidate toward a satisfactory answer—a key skill for an interviewer.

**Conclusion:** The open-ended nature of general AI makes it unsuitable for the structured task of an interview.

### 3. The Domain Expertise Gap: Superficial Knowledge 📖

While AIs possess broad knowledge, they lack the deep, role-specific expertise to truly challenge a candidate or provide expert-level feedback.

*   **✏️ Basic Corrections (Meta AI):** When presented with a deliberately inaccurate description of Apache Spark, Meta AI provided a correct, but textbook-level, explanation. It could not probe deeper into the candidate's flawed reasoning.

*   **🎁 Giving Away the Answer (Grok AI):** When the candidate failed to provide a Netflix-specific architecture, the AI simply provided the ideal answer itself. This turns a test into a lecture and fails to assess a candidate's problem-solving skills.

**Conclusion:** A specialized tool like MockSy can be pre-loaded with deep, role-specific knowledge bases, ensuring a much higher fidelity of technical assessment than a generalist model can provide.
